Violating or attempting to violate the Tibia Rules may lead to a temporary suspension of characters and accounts. In severe cases the removal or modification of character skills, attributes and belongings, as well as the permanent removal of characters and accounts without any compensation may be considered. The sanction is based on the seriousness of the rule violation and the previous record of the player. It is determined at the sole discretion of CipSoft and can be imposed without any previous warning.<br><br>

These rules may be changed at any time. All changes will be announced on the official website.

Substantial organisational and technical measures have been taken to ensure the security of all personal data that is collected. This privacy policy explains in detail which information is collected and for which purposes it can be processed and used.

<ol><li>CipSoft collects, processes and uses personal data for the conclusion and execution of a user\'s service agreement with CipSoft. Personal data comprises stock data such as name, address and date of birth of a user as well as usage data such as account number, password and IP address.</li><br>

<li>CipSoft collects the usage data that is automatically determined and transmitted by web browsers or any other client software whenever CipSoft\'s websites (tibia.com, cipsoft.com or any other of CipSoft\'s websites) or one of CipSoft\'s other online services is used. Such usage data includes, but is not limited to, IP address, browser version, access time, information on the type and the aim of requests and data about hardware and software of the user\'s computer system. It is saved in protocol files, with some of the information being stored in anonymous form. Among other purposes, this data is used by CipSoft for the compilation of anonymous statistical surveys on the use of their online services and for the error analysis and the optimisation of their service.</li><br>

<li>CipSoft uses, among other things, cookies to collect, process and use usage data in order to allow, for instance, the management of accounts and of personal settings, the participation in the discussion forum, and the use of further personalised services.</li><br>

<li>CipSoft collects, processes and uses stock and usage data, to the extent that is necessary in individual cases, if it is required to reveal and to stop fraudulent behaviour or any other form of using CipSoft\'s services which violates legal regulations or the service agreement. In particular, CipSoft reserves the right to log, process and use information such as the time and the content of conversations and expressions of opinion that take place in their online services if there are complaints, reports or other credible indications of behaviour that violates legal regulations or the service agreement, for example the serious insulting of other users. This regulation extends to all parts of CipSoft\'s online service, including, but not limited to, guild channels, private channels and private messages.</li><br>

<li>CipSoft collects, processes and uses personal data in connection with complaints and requests to their user support in order to comply with requests in as efficient and satisfactory a manner as possible. Data that is collected for such purposes includes, but is not limited to, the email address, the date of the contact and its content. Also, CipSoft processes and uses this data to compile anonymous statistical surveys for the optimisation of their customer support.</li><br>

<li>CipSoft collects, processes and uses personal data for the purpose of conducting marketing actions such as the sending of emails that contain general information or promotional content, provided that the user agreed to receiving such emails separately during the account creation process or at any later time by selecting the option \"Newsletter\" on the account page. Every user can unsubscribe from receiving this kind of information at any time. This can either be done by deselecting the aforementioned account option \"Newsletter\" or by directly clicking on the unsubscribe link in any received newsletter. Also, CipSoft processes and uses personal data to compile anonymous statistical surveys for the purpose of improving their range of services.</li><br>

<li>CipSoft displays character names to all visitors on all of CipSoft\'s websites as well as to all users in their online services in connection with certain game activities of a user in order to allow other users to selectively contact this user. This occurs, for example, when the user uses characters online, when they act as parts of character associations, or possibly when they are registered in high score lists. Furthermore, CipSoft generally makes usage data of characters, for example the time of its most recent use or information on its death, available to all visitors on all of CipSoft\'s websites as well as to all users in CipSoft\'s online services. CipSoft makes information, such as the record of rule violations or the list of defeated characters, available to certain other users, who have a supervisory role among the community of users.</li><br>

<li>In so far as the transfer of data to third parties is not explicitly allowed by law, especially by the German BDSG, CipSoft<ul>
<li>passes on personal data, to the extent that is necessary, to law enforcement and supervisory authorities for the purpose of preventing dangers to the national or public security as well as for the prosecution of criminal offences.</li>
<li>passes on the name, address and, to the extent that is necessary in individual cases, further personal data of users to its partner companies, for example for the purpose of handling payment transactions or to provide other services in the framework of the users\' service agreement with CipSoft.</li>
</ul>
Third parties may possibly be based in countries outside of the European Union, but they are bound to protect personal data to the same extent as CipSoft. CipSoft will not, aside from the aforementioned cases, pass on personal data to third parties, and solely employees of CipSoft have access to personal data in order to fulfil the tasks specified above.</li><br>

<li>CipSoft may change this privacy policy at any time. CipSoft will notify all users about the changes by placing a prominent notice on the website of Tibia. The changed privacy policy will take effect 30 days after it has been officially announced. It will fully apply to any user who has not revoked his or her declaration of consent within this period of time. All users are required to review this policy at regular intervals to keep themselves informed about any changes.</li><br>

<li>Users can revoke their declaration of consent to the processing of their personal data as specified above anytime with future effect by sending an email to support@tibia.com. In case of revocation, their accounts at CipSoft will be blocked, and CipSoft\'s personalised services will no longer be available via these accounts.</li></ol>

<b>Comment</b><br><br>
<b>Insulting names:</b><br>
Please make sure your name does not offend your fellow players. Names that contain any kind of insult (<font color="#FF0000">"Stupid Retard"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Thiago the Moron"</font>) will not be tolerated.<br><br>

<b>Racist names:</b><br>
Tibia is an international game where people from all over the world meet and communicate. Naturally, racist names (<font color="#FF0000">"Arab hater"</font>,  <font color="#FF0000">"White Power"</font>) will never be tolerated.<br><br>

<b>Sexually related names:</b><br>
Tibia is a game that is largely enjoyed by minors. As a result, we aim to keep any names referring to sex or sexual orientation (<font color="#FF0000">"Hetero Guy"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Porn star"</font>) out of the game. Also names that include sexually related body parts (<font color="#FF0000">"Nipple"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Breastfeeder"</font>) will be locked.<br>
Similarly, names of celebrities who are connected to sex in some way are not desirable. This includes, for example, the names of porn stars, pimps or prostitutes.<br><br>

<b>Drug-related names:</b><br>
Names that explicitly relate to drugs and other illegal substances  (<font color="#FF0000">"Weedsmoker"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Junkie"</font>) are undesirable and will be locked accordingly. The same is true for names that refer to the excessive use of alcohol (<font color="#FF0000">"Drunkard"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Alcohol abuse"</font>). This rule also prohibits the use of names of famous drug dealers (<font color="#FF0000">"Pablo Escobar"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"George Jung"</font>).<br><br>

<b>Harassing:</b><br>
Names that have been created with the sole intention to harass other players (<font color="#FF0000">"Wheelchair Marcin"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Fat <random character="" name="">"</random></font>) or to threaten others in real life (<font color="#FF0000">"Beatyou Afterschool"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Killyou Inrl"</font>) are illegal and will be locked and may even lead to a harsher punishment.<br><br>

<b>Generally objectionable names:</b><br>
There are many more names that people may find offensive for a variety of reasons. For instance, the names of many body fluids and excrements are offensive (<font color="#FF0000">"Snot"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Lord Feces"</font>), as are the names of diseases or handicaps (<font color="#FF0000">"Asthma"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Moe the Mongolist"</font>) or references to organised crime (<font color="#FF0000">"Mafia Hitman"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Narcotrafico"</font>).
Also, celebrities who are infamous for committing a  serious crime or their inhuman actions are prohibited by this rule, e.g. serial killers (<font color="#FF0000">"Charles Manson"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Ted Bundy"</font>) or dictators (<font color="#FF0000">"Hitler"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Benito Mussolini"</font>).<br><br>

<b>Comment</b><br><br>
<b>Names that contain parts of sentences:</b><br>
With the exception of guild names, names that are sentences (<font color="#FF0000">"Go home"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Johnrox"</font>) are not allowed as names. The same is true for names that are incomplete sentences (<font color="#FF0000">"Knight likes to"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Dances with wolves"</font>), names that contain possessive pronouns (<font color="#FF0000">"My lovely Fanny"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Your mother"</font>) as well as for names that contain exclamations or greetings (<font color="#FF0000">"Oh my god"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Hi Dude"</font>).<br><br>

<b>Names that contain badly formatted words:</b><br>
Our name creating system already enforces certain rules for names to avoid badly formatted names. For instance, names must start with a capital letter, special characters and numbers are illegal etc. Names that can be created even though they are illegal due to bad formatting include names that lack spaces (<font color="#FF0000">"Miketheknight"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Wingsofbeauty"</font>) or have weirdly placed spaces (<font color="#FF0000">"Mik ethekni ght"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Wi Ngsofb eauty"</font>).<br><br>

<b>Names that contain nonsensical combinations of letters:</b><br>
You are welcome to come up with a fantasy name. However, it should not only consist of a random string of letters (<font color="#FF0000">"Jasdhsjhf"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Aauoiee"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Huahueahua"</font>). Likewise, names which only contain a string of letters which is not pronounceable due to missing vowels (<font color="#FF0000">"Knightplk"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Mr Robinson"</font>) are illegal. Names that use the same string of letters more than twice (<font color="#FF0000">"John John John"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Master Bababa"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Hahaha"</font>) and names that obviously contain too many typing mistakes (<font color="#FF0000">"Drruuiidd"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Kinght off Svvargrund"</font>) are prohibited, too.<br><br>

<b>Comment</b><br><br>
<b>Names that advertise brands, products or services of third parties:</b><br>
Names in Tibia should not contain advertising for third parties, e.g. names including worldwide known products (<font color="#FF0000">"Peter Smarties"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Snickers Druid"</font>) or companies and brands (<font color="#FF0000">"Disney Paladin"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Microsoft Warrior"</font>). Names that contain titles of other online games fall under this rule, too.<br><br>

<b>Names that advertise content which is not related to the game:</b><br>
Tibia is not a platform to advertise trades which contain content which has nothing to do with Tibia. Consequently, also names that imply this kind of trades are prohibited (<font color="#FF0000">"Mobile Sale"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Buy headset"</font>).<br><br>

<b>Names that advertise trades for real money:</b><br>
Names in Tibia may not contain advertising that imply the selling of Tibia items for real life money (<font color="#FF0000">"Dollar for Armor"</font>).<br><br>

</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><br>

<b>Comment</b><br><br>
<b>Names that express religious or political views:</b><br>
Tibia is a game in which religious or political views should be of no importance. For this reason names are illegal that refer to a special religion (<font color="#FF0000">"Hindu master"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Muslim the paladin"</font>), to a person that is connected to a certain religion (<font color="#FF0000">"Jesus Christ Sorcerer"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"John the Buddha"</font>) or to a position which only exists in one religion (<font color="#FF0000">"Pope Frank"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Rabbi Druid"</font>).<br>
Furthermore, names that express political views (<font color="#FF0000">"Democrat"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Peter the Anarchist"</font>) or refer to internationally known politicians (<font color="#FF0000">"Master George Bush"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Lula da Silva"</font>) are not allowed.<br><br>

<b>Names that do not fit into Tibia\'s medieval fantasy setting:</b><br>
Tibia\'s setting is a medieval fantasy world. For this reason the names of its inhabitants should fit into the setting. They must not refer to things which are completely out of place in this world (<font color="#FF0000">"Spaceshuttle commander"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Remote control"</font>).<br><br>

<b>Comment</b><br><br>
<b>Names that support or incite the violation of the Tibia Rules:</b><br>
Of course, all names that support rule violations (<font color="#FF0000">"Friend of Insults"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Hackers Rox"</font>) or incite a violation of the Tibia Rules (<font color="#FF0000">"Spam Sponsor"</font>) are illegal in Tibia and might also lead to further punishments.<br><br>

<b>Names that announce or imply the violation of the Tibia Rules:</b><br>
Names that clearly announce the breaking of a Tibia Rule (<font color="#FF0000">"Sellacc"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Harry Botter"</font>) will not only be namelocked, but might also receive a further punishment. The same applies to names which obviously fake an official position (<font color="#FF0000">"Admin on Aldora"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"God Durin"</font>).<br> A name will be considered to imply a rule violation simply by naming it (<font color="#FF0000">"Bothater"</font>, <font color="#FF0000">"Spammkiller"</font>).<br><br>

</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><br>

<b>Comment</b><br><br>
<b>Insulting statements:</b><br>
Treat other players politely and refrain from insulting anyone. It also does not matter in which language the insult takes place, if you hide it like "a**h***" or if you express yourself in a non-verbal way, e.g. by using ASCII art - it is the intention that counts. If someone is trying to provoke you, the best thing you can do is to ignore that person instead of responding to him or her angrily. Please do not take everything too seriously. Statements such as "You noob!" might annoy you, but they are not really serious insults. However, severely insulting statements may lead to a punishment.<br><br>

<b>Racist statements:</b><br>
Tibia is an international game where people from all over the world meet and communicate. Naturally, statements made to insult or mock a certain country or its inhabitants are not tolerated in Tibia. The same goes of course for a certain nation or ethnic group.<br><br>

<b>Sexually related statements:</b><br>
Please remember that many children play this game and that certain topics are not suited for their ears and eyes. For this reason all references to sex, sexual related body parts or a sexual orientation have no place in the game or on  the Tibia website. Note that this rule is not intended to be discriminatory in any way.  Rather, it aims to preserve the respect amongst players.<br><br>

<b>Drug-related statements:</b><br>
Drugs are illegal in most countries of the world. Also, drugs are not a suitable topic for children. For these reasons, any drug-related statements are prohibited and will be punished.<br><br>

<b>Harassing statements:</b><br>
It is not allowed to make statements that are intended to harass other players. Above all, all statements in which other players are threatened in real life are highly illegal and will lead to severe punishments.<br><br>

<b>Generally objectionable statements:</b><br>
There are many more conceivable statements by which people could feel offended for various reasons. Posts, for example, in which somebody claims that another player has died, even though this is not true, are very tasteless and will not be tolerated.<br><br>

<b>Comment</b><br><br>
<b>Excessively repeating identical or similar statements:</b><br>
You surely know from experience how annoying it can be if players flood the public channels in the game, e.g. by repeating the same sentence every few seconds. This makes it impossible to lead proper conversations or to announce offers. Of course, there is an automatic control to prevent the worst spamming in the local chat and all public channels. Thus, you may not write more than one line of text every 2.5 seconds for a longer period of time. Also, you will only be allowed to state your offer or request once every two minutes in the advertising channel. Players who evade the spam control by slowly repeating messages that disturb conversations may still be banished for spamming. This rule applies also for repeating the same statement in the forum. Please make a post only on the one board on which the content of your post fits best.<br><br>

<b>Using badly formatted or nonsensical text:</b><br>
You should not create nonsensical postings to keep threads alive. Only reply to threads if you have something to say, e.g. do not just reply "hehe" to each thread just because you would like to raise your post count.<br>
In general, you should always refrain from making nonsensical statements such as "asdfsdfskhjkh". Also, please note that badly formatted text such as "-*-*-*-*I $eLl @rr0wzz*-*-*-*-" is not desirable in public chat channels or on the Tibia website and may lead to a punishment just like plain spamming.<br><br>

<b>Comment</b><br><br>
<b>Advertising brands, products or services of third parties:</b><br>
Tibia is not the place to advertise brands, products or services of third parties. This includes, for example, advertising other games, offering items from another game for Tibia items. Also advertising other companies or their goods and services is illegal.<br><br>

<b>Advertising content which is not related to the game:</b><br>
Trades or offers which are not related to Tibia are out of place in the game or on the Tibia website. We do not want anyone using the channels or the website of Tibia to sell items such as a mobile phone or a computer.<br><br>

<b>Advertising trades for real money:</b><br>
It is not allowed to advertise trades of any kind that involve the paying of real money. This does not only apply to the trading of real items for cash, but also to offers to buy or sell Tibia items for real money. Please note that Premium Scrolls are considered to be regular Tibia items once they have been transferred into the game, so you are free to trade them against any other Tibia item and to advertise these trades. However, offers to buy or sell Premium Scrolls for real money are clear violations of this rule. Note that it is also illegal to advertise game code trades as game codes represent real money.<br><br>

<b>Comment</b><br><br>
<b>Religious or political public statements:</b><br>
Our intention is not to restrict the freedom of opinion, but to keep controversial topics such as religion and politics, which are likely to lead to heated discussions, out of the game. For this reason, they are not considered to be suitable topics for the Tibia website or the public channels in the game.<br><br>

<b>Public statements which are not related to the topic of the used channel or board:</b><br>
Please make sure you use the appropriate channel or board if you want to state something. For example, the advertising channel and the trade boards are restricted to advertising Tibia-related content only, so do not hold private conversations there. Vice versa, do not post trade messages in the help channel or on the event board, as they should be reserved to advertising channel and the trade boards only.<br><br>

<b>Non-English public statements:</b><br>
Generally the use of other languages than English is allowed in most channels and on the Tibia website. However, on the Event board, the Proposal board and the Auditorium, the use of English is required. These boards are looked after by our community managers and it is necessary that they understand all of your comments and ideas. Moreover, there are often discussions on the Auditorium - to ensure that all players understand all arguments of other players in these discussions, the use of English is mandatory. Further, English is required on the Gameplay board and, in the game, in the English chat.<br><br>

Every person has a right to privacy. For this reason, the only person that may share data of her-/himself is the person her-/himself.

<b>Comment</b><br><br>
<b>Statements that support or incite a violation of the Tibia Rules:</b><br>
Please do not encourage others to violate a Tibia Rule, for example by telling someone "Hey, if you spam your offer several times in a row, it will be much easier to notice!". Refrain from putting other players into trouble and rather inform players who violate a rule about their mistake. Note that statements that incite a rule violation are illegal and will be punished, even if they were intended to be a sarcastic remark or a joke.<br>
Also, do not publicly glorify rule breaks, for example by stating "Anyone who fishes without using a macro is plain dumb". This gives an extremely bad example to other players, and you will get banished for such statements since you obviously support rule violations.<br><br>

<b>Statements that announce or imply a violation of the Tibia Rules:</b><br>
If you make a statement in which you announce that you are going to violate a Tibia Rule, you will most likely be punished for it. Also statements in which a player implies that he has violated a Tibia Rule, is going to violate a Tibia Rule or supports the violation of a Tibia Rule are illegal.<br><br>

<b>Comment</b><br><br>
<b>Exploiting obvious errors of the game:</b><br>
A bug is an obvious error of Tibia or any other part of CipSoft\'s services, which is surely not intended to be that way - for example if the fire wave of dragons would suddenly heal you instead of damaging you, or if an NPC sells a certain rune for a much lower price than all other NPCs. If you abuse any obvious game error, e.g. by buying hundreds of backpacks of these cheap runes, your account will be most likely punished for it. Note that already a statement in which you admit that you have abused an obvious error may lead to a punishment.<br><br>

<b>Exploiting obvious errors of any other part of CipSoft\'s services:</b><br>
Also possible errors that might appear outside of the game may not be exploited, e.g. if there is a bug that allows you to manipulate the website in a way that you can transfer a character to another game world although it has a black skull, you are not allowed to abuse this error. CipSoft\'s services include among others all of CipSoft\'s other products and its websites. Therefore also a statement like "Yesterday I duplicated items in TibiaME by using this cool bug." may lead to a punishment.<br><br>

<b>Comment</b><br><br>
<b>Manipulating the official client program:</b><br>
Manipulating the client program to try gaining an advantage compared to other players is not only extremely unfair but may also cause serious errors in the game. In such cases you cannot expect any assistance from CipSoft concerning level, skill, item or character loss due to manipulating their software or the game protocol. Also, manipulating the client program may lead to a punishment.<br><br>

<b>Using additional software to play the game:</b><br>
Keep in mind that you are supposed to play the game yourself, not to have a tool or program play it for you. Doing so gives you an unfair advantage over players who invest time and effort to gain power. Using unofficial software such as a macro program or a so-called "tasker" or "bot" to automatically execute actions in Tibia for you may lead to a punishment. Thus, play fair.<br>
Using additional software to play the game such as cheat programs is not only forbidden, but also poses a high hacking risk. These programs - especially if offered to you by other players - often contain a virus, trojan or some other sort of backdoor through which a hacker can access your computer and take over your account. It is highly recommended not to ever download and use such a cheat program.<br><br>

You must not, at any time, pretend to be a member of the CipSoft team or to have their legitimation or powers, particularly if done to threaten or trick other players.

<b>Publishing clearly wrong information about CipSoft or its services:</b><br>
Publishing clearly wrong information will not be tolerated and may lead to a punishment of your account. Of course you do not have to fear a punishment if you for example write an article about CipSoft and do not have the number of staff members correct. However, if you publish information about CipSoft that is clearly wrong, particularly to harm CipSoft or its services, it may lead to a punishment.<br><br>

<b>Calling a boycott against CipSoft or its services:</b><br>
You may not call a boycott against CipSoft in Tibia or on the Tibia website. E.g. calls to stop playing Tibia or to stop buying premium time will not be tolerated and will be punished accordingly.<br><br>

<b>Comment</b><br><br>
<b>Intentionally given wrong or misleading information to CipSoft:</b><br>
You are very welcome to use our report and complaint channels, but you may not abuse them to hand out clearly wrong information. By no means, may you give wrong information with the intention to harm other players or to escape a justified punishment. Keep in mind that if a statement is reported not only this statement but also several statements before and after are transmitted to us. So if you report somebody for an offensive statement and it is clearly visible that this statement has only been made because somebody has asked for a translation, you will most likely be punished for this false report.<br>
This rule is valid for all channels and tools through which you have contact to a member of the CipSoft team.<br><br>

<b>Comment</b><br><br>
<b>Account trading:</b><br>
You are not allowed to sell your own account or to give it away for free. Vice versa, you must not buy another players\' account or accept their account data. This also includes not to accept or give away accounts as a present. Each account is assigned to one person only and this person may not pass on the account to somebody else. Statements like, e.g. "I\'m selling a level 30 knight", "I trade my sorcerer on Antica for a sorcerer on Nova" or "I\'m buying a paladin" - whether in the game or on a website - will lead to a punishment of your account. The same is true for a comment like "New Owner" on your account or character information.<br><br>

<b>Account sharing</b>:<br>
An account should always be used by one person only. Only the person that created an account is allowed to use it. It is unfair towards other players if a group of several people shares one character e.g. to be online 24 hours a day. Moreover, you will be held responsible for everything that happens on your character. So if your brother violates a Tibia Rule with one of your characters while you are in the bathroom, you will have to deal with the punishment.<br>
Sharing your account data with another person is not only against the rules, but also a high security risk for your account. It is actually one of the most wide-spread reasons why a player loses his account. What if you suddenly got into a serious argument with a person that you consider your friend and who you are sharing your account with? Or what if one of your friends suddenly decides that he would like to play your shared character alone and takes over your account before you can react? Account sharing is not worth the risk, which is why you should never do it. Besides, it can as well lead to an account punishment.<br><br>

<b>Comment</b><br><br>
<b>Trying to steal other players\' account data:</b><br>
Stealing another player\'s account or personal data or hacking an account is actually a real life crime and can lead to an investigation by the police if the original owner of the account decides to report it to them.<br>
Apart from this, any attempt to steal a player\'s account or personal data such as spreading links in the game or on the website meant to trick other players into downloading a keylogger will lead to a long account banishment or even to the deletion of your account. If you should coincidentally get access to another player\'s account, e.g. because he treats his account data carelessly, you are required not to abuse this knowledge but should inform that player to secure his account.<br><br>

<b>Attacking, disrupting or damaging the operation of any part of CipSoft\'s services:</b><br>
Trying to attack, disrupt or damage CipSoft\'s servers or any other part of a CipSoft service may not only lead to an exclusion from the game, but may also lead to an investigation by the police. Such behaviour includes for example DDoS attacks on our game servers to create lags or kicks, on the login server to prevent that players can log into the game or on the website server to hinder players on using the forum properly.<br><br>

<b>Violating any applicable law, the Tibia Service Agreement or rights of third parties:</b><br>
If a player claims in Tibia or on the Tibia website that he has done something or plans to do something that violates any applicable law he might get punished for it. The same is true if a player violates the Tibia Service Agreements. Every player has to follow them at all times.
